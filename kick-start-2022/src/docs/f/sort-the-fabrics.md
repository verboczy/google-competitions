# Sort the Fabrics

## Solution

The idea was to sort a copy of list this way and sort a copy of list that way. 
First, I sorted the list by unique id to make other list keep the order of same values.

## Experience

It was a good getting started exercise.
I wasn't that quick with the coding, but I wasn't hurrying, and everything I wrote worked at once, which felt good.

The ideas came fast, but I thought at first, it may not be fast enough.
